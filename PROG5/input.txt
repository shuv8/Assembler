London is the capital of Great Britain
   I   love   assembly   
A night, a street, a lamp, a drugstore
A meaningless and dismal light
A quarter century outpours
It’s all the same; No chance to flight;
You’d die and rise anew, begotten;
All would repeat as ever might:
The street, the icy rippled water,
The store, the lamp, the lonely night;
